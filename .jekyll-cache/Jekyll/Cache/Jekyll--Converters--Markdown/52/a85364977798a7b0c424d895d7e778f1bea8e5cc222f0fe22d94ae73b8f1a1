I"¿<p>I started this project as a way to learn about the <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">Mapbox Javascript API</a>. I wanted to explore parsing a geoJSON file and putting the features (points) on a map.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services has opened many different Regions over the last 12 years, all over the globe. I thought it would be cool to visualize them on a map. I first created a geoJSON file with the help of <a href="http://geojson.io">geojson.io</a>, then I followed Mapboxâ€™s <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/timeline-animation/">example</a> to create a map.</p>

<p>I hope you like it. Find it <a href="/maps/aws-timeline.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
