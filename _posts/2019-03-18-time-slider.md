I started this project as a way to learn about the [Mapbox Javascript API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/). I wanted to explore parsing a geoJSON file and putting the features (points) on a map.

Amazon Web Services has opened many different Regions over the last 12 years, all over the globe. I thought it would be cool to visualize them on a map. I first created a geoJSON file with the help of [geojson.io](http://geojson.io), then I followed Mapbox's [example](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/timeline-animation/) to create a map.

I hope you like it. Find it <a href="/maps/aws-timeline.html" target="_blank">here</a>
