I've always loved comedy—from Steve Martin to Monty Python, it has always brought me joy. I enjoy many different types and forms of comedy. When I was in elementary school, I loved telling jokes. One of the first jokes I told was "Pete and Repeat," and discovering that I could make other people laugh was wonderful.

I find it fascinating to think about joke construction—figuring out which words or phrasing make something funnier is a rewarding intellectual exercise. *Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee* provides great insights into comedians and what makes them tick: how they construct jokes, what kinds of material they use, and the way they shape humor.

There's nothing quite like making someone else laugh. Figuring out the timing and delivery that makes them laugh is something I always enjoy.
