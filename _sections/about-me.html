<p>I was born in a small town. Now I live in a big city. In between I got a Computer Science degree from <a href="http://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer</a>. Now I work for a federal contractor in Washington, D.C.. I write code in Ruby and python, and do DevOps. To that end I have both an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional and an AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification</p>
